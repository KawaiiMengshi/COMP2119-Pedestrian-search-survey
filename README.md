# Pedestrian-search-survey
In this work, we review some of the popular method, and list some key point of each one. Then we ran the code of a Seqset paper ouselves, to show that how it works and do some further performance analysis

The code is from https://github.com/serend1p1ty/SeqNet, we're running the original code to check the performance.
